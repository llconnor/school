<h2>Description</h2>

Anyone who happens not to be an <i>n</i>th generation Pittsburgher,
for large values of <i>n</i>, knows that it is often impossible
to get from point A to point B in this town.
A little electronic help is called for: a program which, given a source
point A and a target point B, will find the shortest possible route
from A to B.
<p>

To simplify things considerably, we won't make an attempt to base our
program on a real map of P'gh (which is probably a fractal of dimension
2.789), but instead use some artificial directed graphs whose edges
are labeled by positive real numbers.
Your program will read in a data file that describes the graph,
as well as a source and target vertex.
In response, the program prints the distance between the two vertices,
and, optionally, a shortest path from one to the other.
Internally, the program uses a graph exploration algorithm known as
Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, see below for an explanation.
You might also wish to read chapter 15.4 in your book for more information.
<p>

The key ingredient for the algorithm is a priority queue that is used
to keep track of the nearest vertices in the graph.
<p>

<h2>Data Structures &amp; Algorithms</h2>

First off, you need to implement a directed graph class.
The class has to contain an adjacency list as well as information about
the cost of each edge.
Here is the class definition in my solution:
<pre>
class  Graph
{
    AdjacencyLists   A;
public:
    Graph() {}
    Graph( int n ): A(n) {}
    void   set_size( int n );
    void   insert( int a, int b, float x );
    float  distance( int a, int b, list<int>& P ) const;
    bool   edge( int a, int b ) const;
    int    size() const { return A.size(); }
};

</pre>
For example, the second constructor builds a graph with n nodes, but no edges.
The insert operation adds an edge from x to y of cost d.
The distance function returns the length of a shortest path from
s to t, as computed by Dijkstra's algorithm, and deposits a  
shortest path in the list P (a list of integers, which could be implemented
as  <code>list&lt;int&gt;</code> using the STL, you can also use
your own if you prefer). 
This is one plausible line of attack, but there are many others.
<p>

In order to calculate distances (and shortest paths), you will need a priority
queue, a data structure that supports an insert operation, a delete_min operation,
and a promote operation.
Here is the outline of the algorithm.
Suppose n is the number of vertices in the graph. 
We maintain an array <code>float  dist[n]</code> that contains our current
estimate for the distance from the source vertex s:  <code>dist[t]</code>
is the distance from s to t.
We write  <code>cost(x,y)</code> for the cost of the edge (x,y), though
in your program you should not implement this as an actual function call. 
This distance is used to organize the priority queue. 
<p>

<pre>
        dist[s] = 0;
        insert s into Q

        while( ! Q.empty() )
        {
              u = Q.delete_min();
              for each edge  (u,v)  do
                    if(  dist[u] + cost(u,v) < dist[v] )
                    {
                         dist[v] = dist[u] + cost(u,v);
                         insert/promote v in Q
                    }
        }
</pre>

Thus, the first choice of u will be s itself.
All vertices v such that there is an edge (s,v) will be inserted into Q, and
one with a cheapest possible edge cost is chosen next.
Then we encounter the neighbors of that vertex, 
and so on and so forth.
In the end, <code>dist[x]</code> will be the true distance from s to x,
for all vertices x.

<h2>Interface</h2>

Make sure to adhere to the description given below in every little detail.
Our testing scripts will not work unless you program behaves precisely as
explained here, and you will lose credit. 

<p>

<ol>

  <li>In plain mode, a call
      <pre>
      > shortest  infile src trg 
      </pre>
      will read the graph stored in infile, and then compute the distance from
      src to trg (positive integers in the appropriate range). 
      Likewise, a call
      <pre>
      > shortest  -p infile src trg 
      </pre>
      will cause a shortest path to be displayed in addition to the distance.  

      <p>

      For example, for the file <code>graph3</code> provided on the server,
      we get

      <pre>
      hw4 620 >shortest graph3 1 8
      11.2
      hw4 621 >shortest -p graph3 1 8
      11.2
      1  4  5  8  
      hw4 622 >shortest -p graph3 1 7
      infinity
      </pre>

      Hence, there is no path from vertex 1 to vertex 7 in the graph.
      <p>

      
  <li>The format of the input file is as follows:

      <pre>
      GRAPH
      5
      1  2  1.5
      2  3  2.0
      3  4  0.5
      4  1  .9999
      5  1  1.9999
      5  2  2.0
      </pre>

      This would epresent a graph on 5 vertices,
      consisting of a square (on 1,2,3,4) and
      two extra edges from vertex 5 to the square. The edge costs are random. 
      <p>

      Thus, the first line in the data file contains the keyword <code>GRAPH</code>,
      the second line contains a single integer, the number of vertices,
      and the following lines contain adjacency information and the cost of
      the edges. <p>

      
  <li>Since there are ample opportunities for incorrect data in this assignment,
      be particularly careful in checking the input.
      For example, test if the source and target vertices are in the proper range.
      Also, while reading the graph input file, test that the edge
      costs are all positive.
      If the data file contains multiple occurences of the same edge
      (possibly with different costs), your program must complain and quit. 
      However, you don't have to worry about parsing files of the wrong form:
      if the input file is does not conform to our standard, your program
      may fail in arbitrary ways (e.g., the keyword GRAPH might be missing). 
      <p>

      You also have to check that the vertices given on the commandline are
      in the proper range.
      Complain and exit if they are not.
      <p>

</ol>

<h4>Nitty-gritty</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
      You can use the STL <code>vector</code> and <code>list</code> classes
      (e.g., for the adjacency lists in your graph class)
      but you must write your own priority queue implementation.
      Make sure that all the operations are logarithmic in the size of the queue. <p>
      <p>

  <li>
      Keep your directed class graph simple.
      A reasonable way to store the costs for the edges is to place the corresponding
      float right in the adjacency list (modify the nodes correspondingly).
      You must be able to access the edge costs in O(1) time, given the edge. 
      <p>

  <li>There is a little glitch in dealing with infinite costs:  we are using
      floats to represent real numbers, and floats do not allow for a value of
      infinity.
      You can hack around this problem in several ways.
      A particularly nasty solution is to use -1 to represent infinity.
      Or you could use a special class <code>Real</code> that behaves
      properly.
      <p>
      Take your pick.
      <p>


  <li>
      Make sure that your program returns <code>infinity</code> when
      the query involves a target vertex that is not reachable from the source.
      In path mode, the program should print out no path, only <code>infinity</code>.

<p>
  <li>Again, think about the Knuth Trip Test:
      what to do with empty graphs, graphs with just one vertex,
      graphs with no edges, ...
      We will test all these cases. 
      <p>

</ul>

<p>
<hr>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>

<h2>Files</h2>

Write files  <code>pqueue.h</code>, <code>pqueue.cc</code>, 
<code>graph.h</code>  and <code>graph.cc</code>
that implement your priority queues graphs, respectively. 
Then write a main file <code>shortest.cc</code>
that reads the input file and provides the user interface. 
<p>

However, you may prefer to split up your code into more compilation units. 
If you decide to do this, you must modify the makefile correspondingly. 
When we test your code, it must suffice to type <code>make</code> to get 
the executable, whatever compilation steps may be necessary to 
produce them. 
<p>

Files on the server:

<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><a href=graph1>graph1</a> A path of length 10.
  <li><a href=graph2>graph2</a> A cycle of length 10. 
  <li><a href=graph3>graph3</a> A 3 x 3 grid, plus some extra edges:

      <img align="middle" src="3by3.gif"width=300 height=300 >
      <p>

  <li><a href=Makefile>Makefile</a>
  <li><a href=questions.txt>questions.txt</a>
</ul>
</blockquote>

There are compiled versions of the program at 
<a href=shortest.linux>shortest.linux</a> and
<a href=shortest.sun>shortest.sun</a>
that you can use to compare your output to ours.

<h3>Procedures</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
      Copy the files in
      <code>/afs/andrew/course/15/211-1/Homework/hw4</code> to a directory 
      of your own, e.g. by shift-clicking on the links above.
      Make sure the directory is not readable by others.  If you 
      are not sure how to do this, go to <a href=http://polaris.andrew.cmu.edu>
      polaris.andrew.cmu.edu</a> and search for "directory protection".
      <p>

  <li>Answer all the questions in <code>questions.txt</code>.
      Make sure to give us some feedback on the amount of time spent on the
      assignment, its difficulty, and the ultimate degree of happiness the
      assignment helped to produce (or lack thereof).
      Write single digit integers in the appropriate positions (except perhaps for time spent),
      currently indicated by a 0.
      If  you do not modify the 0, we will discard it for statistical purposes.
      <p>
      Do <font color="red">NOT</font> write anything else on these lines,
      use the comment section if you would like to say more about time, difficulty
      or satisfaction.
      <p>


  <li>When you are done, and certain that your program works properly, 
      hand in your code electronically in your directory in 

      <blockquote>
      <code>/afs/andrew/course/15/211-1/Dropoff/hw4/&lt;your login name&gt;</code>
      </blockquote>
      
      Files to hand in minimally:
      <code>graph.h</code>, <code>graph.cc</code>,
      <code>pqueue.h</code>, <code>pqueue.cc</code>, <code>shortest.cc</code>,
      <code>questions.txt</code>. 
      
      <p>

      If you distribute your code over more files, make sure to submit whatever 
      is needed for compilation, modify the makefile correspondingly, and submit
      your makefile together with the code. 
</ol>

<p>

<font color=red>Do not submit binaries, cores, additional test programs you
may have written, or anything else!!!</font>

<h3>Grading</h3>

This time, non-compilation automatically means disaster in the correctness department.
See also the Recommendations below. 

<ul>
  <li>Correctness: 60 pts (30 for the priority queues, 30 for the shortest path algorithm)
  <li>Style: 20 pts 
  <li>Questions: 20 pts
</ul>

Style points will be lost if your program is hard to read:
poorly commented, not properly indented, bad naming conventions, whatever.
Make a real effort to write your code in a way that makes it easy for someone
else to understand what is going on.
Needless to say, this is also a pre-condition for partial credit. 

<p>
<hr>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>


<h3>Recommendations</h3>

A word of warning about makefiles:  if you organize your code differently from
the outline given here, you MUST provide a proper makefile.
You will lose credit if we cannot even compile your code simply because all
we get from you is a collection of random C++ files.
